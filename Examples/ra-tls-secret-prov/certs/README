This directory contains pre-generated example certificates, copied from mbedTLS
for simplicity. In particular:

- `test-ca-sha256.crt` -- RSA SHA256 root CA certificate in PEM format. Loaded
  in client (attester) so that client can verify the server's certificate.
- `server2-sha256.crt` -- RSA SHA256 leaf server certificate in PEM format.
  Loaded in server (verifier) and sent to the client.
- `server2.key` -- RSA private key in PEM format. Loaded in server (verifier).
